### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It was really interesting to use svg files in the 2 different ways I did. I have used svg's before on persinal projects but never in such a mindful way as I did here and I am really happy with how I did.

```html
<body>
  <div class="bgImg">
    <img src="./dist/images/bg-pattern-top.svg" alt="" class="top">
    <img src="./dist/images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg" alt="" class="bot">
  </div>

  <main class="card">
    <div class="card__header"></div>
```

### Continued development

A thing I would like to focus on more are how to work on first really looking at the visual of my project to really have a strong grasp of how I should program it instead of just programming on the go and then having to re-write it like I did on my last 2 projests. Another aspect is to focus on how to use baground img better. 

### Useful resources

- [Vecta.io](https://vecta.io/blog/best-way-to-embed-svg) - This site helped me be able to use SVG files

- [z-index](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/z-index) - This was usefull to allow me to manipulate the image to the position I need.
