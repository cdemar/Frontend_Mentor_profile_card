### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

### Continued development

A thing I would like to focus on more are how to work on first really looking at the visual of my project to really have a strong grasp of how I should program it instead of just programming on the go and then having to re-write it like I did on my last 2 projests. Another aspect is to focus on how to use baground img better. 

### Useful resources

- [Vecta.io](https://vecta.io/blog/best-way-to-embed-svg) - This site helped me be able to use SVG files

- [z-index](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/z-index) - This was usefull to allow me to manipulate the image to the position I need.
